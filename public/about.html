<h1>Brief Intro about Goldie Boy </h1>
This is Vaisu, aka BVC, aka the CEO of Sarcasm and Chaos. She's my baby , my personal roast machine, and the only person who can bully me and still get away with it. She shines brighter than a gold bar in a spotlight — hence the name Goldie Boi. She’s so special to me that if I ever needed a kidney… well, let’s just say I’ve already marked hers on the black market   life with BVC is never boring — it’s a certified comedy show with zero commercial breaks.
